While extensive research in various disciplines has revealed the instituti onal \nhierarchies inherent in these networks, their impacts within GIScience remain underexplored. \nTo fill this gap, this study analyzes the placement patterns of 946 GIScience faculty worldwide \nby mapping the connections between PhD -granting institutions a nd current faculty affiliations. \nOur dataset, which is compiled from volunteer -contributed information, is the most \ncomprehensive collection available in this field. While there may be some limitations in its \nrepresentativeness, its scope and depth provide  a unique and valuable perspective on the global \nplacement patterns of GIScience faculty. Our analysis reveals several influential programs in \nplacing GIScience faculty, with hiring concentrated in the western countries. We examined the \ndiversity index to assess the representation of regions and institutions within the global \nGIScience faculty network. We observe significant internal retention at both the continental \nand country levels, and a high level of non -self-hired ratio at the institutional level. Ov er time, \nresearch themes have also evolved, with growing research clusters emphasis on spatial data \nanalytics, cartography and geovisualization, geocomputation, and environmental sciences, etc. \nThese results illuminate the influence of hiring practices on global knowledge dissemination \nand contribute to promoting academic equity within GIScience and Geography.  \n   \nKeywords : GIScience, Faculty Placement, Academic Mobility, Hiring Network  \n\n--- Page 3 ---\n   \n \n   \n 3 1. Introduction  \nAcademia is profoundly shaped by the dynamics of faculty hiring networks, acting as a \npathway for knowledge dissemination and collaborative research formation (Curran et al., \n2020) . Studies in various disciplines have highlighted the complexities of faculty hiring \nnetworks, with particular attention to how prestige and institutional hierarchies shape academic \ncareers (Clauset et al., 2015; C. A. Lee, 2022) . Prestige, in this context, typically refers to \nwhether a faculty member earned their degree from a high -ranked institution, which can \nsignificantly influence job placement. Clauset et al. (2015)  analyzed the career trajectories of \n19,000 faculty members across business, computer science, and history using network science, \nrevealing a hierarchical nature  in faculty hiring. This hierarchy refers to a system where top -\nranked institutions tend to hire from similarly prestigious institutions, creating a closed loop \nthat limits opportunities for graduates from lower -ranked institutions. Wapman et al. (2022)  \nextended this analysis to a larger dataset of 295,089 U.S. faculty members across 107 fields, \nconfirming that these hierarchical patterns persist across disciplines. Their findings revealed \nwidespread inequality in faculty output, with 80% of domestically  educated faculty coming \nfrom just 20.4% of universities. Such trends perpetuate a concentration of academic power \nwithin a small subset of institutions, limiting the diversity of thought and research that can \nemerge from less prestigious institutions. Geo graphic Information Science (GIScience), as a \ndiscipline, has experienced significant growth in recent decades, with a marked increase in the \nrecruitment of specialized GIS faculty. However, studies on faculty hiring patterns within the \nfield remain limite d, and it is unclear whether the hierarchical hiring structures observed in \nother disciplines also persist while hiring in GIScience.  \nThe patterns of faculty hiring can significantly affect which research themes dominate specific \ndisciplines and how new ideas are circulated. Tervi\u00f6 (2011)  indicates that the division within \neconomics is especially pronounced, reflecting the well -documented \"freshwater\" (Emphasizes \n\n--- Page 4 ---\n   \n \n   \n 4 market efficiency, minimal government intervention; linked to Chicago school of economics) \nand \"saltwater\" schools of thought (Advocates for government intervention, Keynesian \neconomics; linked to coastal universities such as Harvard University), and has r emained stable \nover time. Such divisions continue to perpetuate inequities in knowledge transmission, as PhD \ngraduates carry ideas from their original institutions to new ones, thereby influencing the \nacademic discourse and research directions in their new  environments (C. A. Lee, 2022) . \nWapman et al. (2022)  explored the hiring networks in United States and found that institutional \nprestige heavily influences faculty placement, thereby perpetuating a cycle where prestigious \ndepartments continue to dominate the field\u2019s research output and thematic focus. This \nmovement of ideas, while potentially enriching for the receiving institution, also reinforces \nexisting academic hierarchies, limiting the diversity of perspectives within the field. Currently, \nfew studies focus on the dynamics of knowledge exchange through  hierarchical faculty hiring \nnetworks.  \nHiring networks not only determine who gets hired but also shape research agendas and \nacademic practices by determining who holds gatekeeping roles, such as editors and \ncontributors in influential journals. As Schurr et al. (2020)  point out , the underrepresentation \nof women in these positions in Geography affects the thematic direction of research, often \nprivileging traditional topics over more diverse or intimate perspectives. Franklin et al. (2021)  \nfurther highlight the persistent underrepresentation of women in editorial teams of quantitative \ngeography journals. Additionally, the lack of international representation in gatekeeping roles \nreinforces a narrow, Anglophone -dominated perspective, limitin g the diversity of voices from \nnon-core countries and impacting the global reach of geographical research. The concentration \nof power in hiring networks perpetuates inequalities, affecting the distribution of opportunities \nwithin the field.  \n\n--- Page 5 ---\n   \n \n   \n 5 Research on academic hiring networks has also traditionally been constrained by regional focus, \nwith significant studies emerging from countries and regions such as Europe (Musselin, 2004) , \nJapan (Horta et al., 2011) , the United States (Clauset et al., 2015) , Canada (Nevin, 2019) , and \nItaly (Gallina et al., 2023) . These investigations, while providing valuable insights into the \ndynamics of academic hiring within specific national boundaries, often do not capture the \ncomplexity of global academic mobility and collaboration. The emphasis on national contexts \nhas lef t a gap in understanding how academic networks operate on a worldwide scale, \nparticularly in fields that are inherently global in nature.  \nWhile factors influencing faculty hiring and the resulting academic environment have been \nextensively investigated in select fields like economics (Orland & Padubrin, 2022) , \ncommunication (Mai et al., 2015) , computer science (Way et al., 2016) , urban planning (C. A. \nLee, 2022) , mathematics (FitzGerald et al., 2023) , and geography (Liu et al., 2024) , such \ninsights are notably lacking in the context of GIScience. As an emerging, globally connected \nfield within Geography, GIScience has undergone significant expansion over the past three \ndecades (Buttenfield, 2022; Egenhofer et al., 2016) . Moreover, GIScience is highly \ninternational, as the growing number of GIS programs has attracted a significant number of \ninternational students (Y. Wang et al., 2023) . As a result, there has been a major increase in \nthe recruitment of GIS faculty, specializing in cartography, spatial analysis, remote sensing, \nspatial data science, and GeoAI, among other topics; yet, very little is known about GIScience \nfaculty hiring, pl acement, and networks. To address this gap in understanding, t his article \nexplores the global mobility patterns, research themes, and academic dynamics of GIScience \nfaculty, and aims to answer the following two interrelated research questions:  \n1. What are the global placement patterns of GIScience faculty?  \n2. How are the research themes among GIScience faculty distributed, and how do they evolve \nover time?  \n\n--- Page 6 ---\n   \n \n   \n 6 Our study aims to extend the analysis of hiring network outcomes beyond the confines of \nnational academic hiring networks and well -documented dimensions of gender and affiliation \nwith elite institutions. We examine  how these networks facilitate or hinder the spread of ideas, \nimpacting innovation within GIScience. Specifically, we leverage the GISphere Project1, an \nextensive database that collects, maintains, and shares up -to-date information on global GIS \ngraduate programs and faculty. This data source allows us to examine faculty hiring in \nGIScience not just at the national level but also from a global perspec tive, providing \ninformation on individual research interests and departmental strengths. It is important to note \nthat our dataset relies on volunteer -contributed information, which inherently constrains its \nrepresentativeness \u2014particularly for non -Western countries, where data are comparatively \nunderrepresented. Nonetheless , given the substantial volume of data collected, our study \neffectively captures the picture of the academic landscape in GIScience , and could advance our \nknowledge of diverse geographic a nd institutional contexts within the field. By aggregating \ndetailed information on faculty 's educational backgrounds and work experiences from diverse \nsources, including ORCID, LinkedIn, personal websites, and other online platforms, we create \na global GIS faculty network graph, visually representing the connections between PhD -\ngranting instituti ons and current academic affiliations. Building on the observed global \nplacement pattern, we employ natural language processing (NLP) to assess the significance of \nthe hiring network in facilitating the transmission of knowledge.  \nThe article is organized as follows: Section 2 situates the expansion of GIS education within a \nbroader literature focused on academic hiring patterns in other fields. Section 3 describes the \ndata collection and preprocessing. Section 4 presents the result s to demonstrate global GIS \nfaculty placement patterns. Section 5 discusses the use of NLP and word cloud visualization in \ndetecting research clusters based on research themes and the hiring network within GIScience. \n \n1 https://gisphere.info/  \n\n--- Page 7 ---\n   \n \n   \n 7 Section 6 offers insights and implications for GIS scholars and educational institutions, \nproviding a comprehensive understanding of our findings' scope and contextualizing our \nresearch within the broader GIScience and geography framework.  \n2. Literature Review  \nThis section explores the existing body of research on faculty hiring patterns across academia \nand examines the growth of GIScience as an academic field. By analyzing these two topics \ntogether, we aim to understand how the broader academic hiring trends in fluence and are \nreflected in the specific context of GIScience.  \n2.1 Faculty Hiring Studies Across Academia  \nAcademic hiring trends have been a subject of extensive study across various disciplines. In \nrecent years, there has been growing interest in quantifying the faculty hiring process to \nexamine inequity in academia (Dewidar et al., 2022; Fernandes et al., 2020; E. Lee et al., 2021; \nMai et al., 2015; Orland & Padubrin, 2022; Way et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2023; Xierali et al., \n2021) . Clauset et al. (2015)  pointed out that the faculty hiring process in academia is heavily \ninfluenced by the prestige of academic institutions. They discovered a \"closed doctoral \necosystem\" where prestigious institutions predominantly hire graduates from similarly elite \nuniversi ties, perpetuating a cycle that limits diversity of ideas and innovation in academic fields. \nWapman et al. (2022)  further highlighted this trend, revealing that five U.S. universities have \ntrained 1 -in-8 tenure -track faculty members in the US. The results are consistent with findings \nfrom a range of disciplines. According to Burris (2004) , 32% of sociology faculty in the U.S. \ngraduated from the top five sociology programs. Similarly, 34% of political science faculty \nand 39% of history faculty come from their respective top five programs. In computer science, \nonly 12 percent of faculty were  able to secure jobs at universities more prestigious than where \nthey graduated, a number that drops to 6 percent in economics (Wapman et al., 2022) . In \n\n--- Page 8 ---\n   \n \n   \n 8 Geography (Liu et al., 2024) , there is a prevalent pattern of downward mobility within a \nhierarchical academic structure, where scientists often move to institutions of equal or lower \nprestige. In the meanwhile, the spatial mobility of geography scientists is dominated by North \nAmeri ca, Western and Northern Europe, East Asia, and Oceania, with increasing inequality \nand multipolarity over time.  \nBeyond institutional type and ranking, additional factors influencing academic career \ntrajectories include gender (Weisshaar, 2017) , race/ethnicity (Grier & Poole, 2020) , advisor \nsponsorship (Pinheiro et al., 2017) , and postdoctoral training (Lin & Chiu, 2016) . It is worth \nnoting that postdoctoral positions have emerged as a critical component of the post -PhD labor \nmarket, enabling scholars to expand their professional networks and often serving as a vital \nstepping stone toward securing tenure -track positions. Meanwhile, many scholars follow non -\ntraditional career paths \u2014such as roles in government, industry, visiting professorships, or non -\ntenure -track positions \u2014before establishing a tenure -track position. Given the consistency of \navailable data for scholars\u2019 ed ucational background and career trajectories, our study focuses \nexclusively on PhD -granting institutions; a comprehensive examination of the other factors \nremains a promising avenue for future research.  \n2.2 Expansion of GIScience as an Academic Field & Profession  \nIn recent years, the rapid growth in GIS, fueled by technological advances and the demand for \nspatial analysis, is revolutionizing data -driven solutions across various fields (Longley, 2000) . \nNotably, GIS enhances agriculture through crop planning and soil analysis (Zhang & Cao, \n2019) , aids in managing healthcare resources and public health planning in epidemiology (F. \nWang, 2020) , streamlines routing and traffic in transportation (Bruniecki et al., 2016) , and \nimproves disaster modeling and response (Abdalla & Tao, 2005; Tomaszewski, 2020) . \nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Surveying and Mapping Technicians , 2024) , \n\n--- Page 9 ---\n   \n \n   \n 9 demand for GIS professionals is projected to rise in diverse sectors, with a six percent job \ngrowth anticipated between 2023 and 2033. Moreover, the North American GIS market is \nexpected to expand by USD 11.4 billion, growing at a CAGR (Compound Annual Gro wth Rate) \nof 23.7% from 2024 to 2029, as reported by Technavio (2025) . This evolution has prompted \neducational institutions to not only increase the number of GIS programs but also to enhance \nthem by incorporating more technique -oriented courses to meet the growing demand for highly \nskilled professionals in the field. Thus,  industry trends are reflected in academia, with a \nnoticeable increase in GIScience research and publications. Since Michael F. Goodchild coined \n\u201cgeographical information science\u201d (GIScience) in 1991, GIS publications quadrupled by 2020 \n(Wu et al., 2023) , and the share of international collaborations in GIScience has more than \ntripled since 2000  (Biljecki, 2016) . Additionally, the research scope has broadened into sub -\ndomains like volunteer geographic information, geospatial data science, geovisualization, and \nso on. This expansion fosters an ongoing cycle that boosts funding and the recruitment of more \nGIS-focus ed scholars in academia. Between 2021 and 2023, the National Science Foundation \nhas awarded around 180 grants, amounting to over   $83 million, for research related to GIS \n(Mapping Science , 2023) . As a result of the flourish in the field, there has been a notable \nincrease in the recruitment of specialized GIS faculty in the recent years . We noticed several \ninstitutions have initiated focused cluster hires in GIS faculties, such as the University of \nCalifornia Santa Barbara, University of Wisconsin -Madison, Texas A&M University, Peking \nUniversity, University of Glasgow, and University of Tokyo.  \nDespite extensive research on hiring networks across various fields, GIScience , a crucial \ngeography sub -domain for the past three decades, still lacks substantial studies in this area. \nThis gap underscores the need for in -depth research into the academic mobility within \nGIScience. Such studies are crucial to determine if the faculty  hiring process in GIScience also \nrelies on the institutional hierarchy, affecting research diversity and innovation. Moreover, \n\n--- Page 10 ---\n   \n \n   \n 10 while research in other disciplines often focuses on hiring networks based on institutional data, \nmany studies are limited to U.S. databases (FitzGerald et al., 2023; C. A. Lee, 2022; Wapman \net al., 2022) , excluding global data due to methodological challenges in obtaining it. This study \ncreated a comprehensive global database to analyze faculty hiring networks, advancing \nunderstanding of academic mobility in GIScience.  \n3. Data Collection and Preprocess  \n3.1 Data Source  \nThe dataset employed in this study is sourced from the GISphere Guide2, which provides \ncomprehensive information on approximately 2,065 faculty specializing in Geographic \nInformation Science (GIS) and related fields worldwide (as of July 2023). The repository \ncovers 480 geography graduate programs (offering master\u2019s and doct oral degrees) across 96 \ncountries and regions, with a substantial proportion of faculty categorized into one or more of \nseven sub -disciplines: Geographic Information Science (GIS), Satellite Navigation (GNSS), \nRemote Sensing (RS), Physical Geography, Human  Geography, Urban Planning, and \nTransportation. The dataset includes current institutional affiliations, appointment details, \nresearch interests, and specific areas of expertise (Y. Wang et al., 2023) . Data were collected \nby dedicated GISphere project volunteers between 2019 and 2024 via a combination of \ncrowdsourcing and active searching, and the information is subject to annual verification and \nupdates to ensure accuracy.  \n3.2 Data Preprocessing  \nOur focus is narrowed to faculty  who specialize in the GIS domain. To accurately identify GIS \nfaculty within the broader academic community, our data cleaning and inclusion process \nproceeded as follows  \n \n2 https://gisphere.info/  \n\n--- Page 11 ---\n   \n \n   \n 11 (\n \nFigure 1): \n \nFigure 1. Workflow of data collection and preprocessing.  \nTenure -Track Faculty. GISphere Guide classifies potentially GIS -related faculty into seven \nsub-disciplines, a categorization that reflects the interdisciplinary essence of GIScience.  For \nall faculty listed in the GISphere Guide, our analysis was restricted to tenure -track facu lty \u2014 \na common practice in studies of faculty hiring (Clauset et al., 2015; C. A. Lee, 2022; Wapman \net al., 2022) . In accordance with the American Association of University Professors\u2019 definition \n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n   \n \n   \n 12 of tenure -track positions (Tenure and Teaching -Intensive Appointments , 2010)  and based on \npublicly available information from faculty profiles, we excluded individuals whose titles \nexplicitly indicated that they held non -tenure -track roles or retired, such as Emeritus faculty, \nprofessors of practice, adjunct professors, professors  of teaching, and research professors. \nWhile this approach ensures consistency, we acknowledge that some ambiguity may persist \nwhere departmental practices or titles are not standardized or unclear. Moreover, this exclusion \nrepresents a limitation of the s tudy, as it may overlook the significant contributions of these \nroles to academic research, teaching/mentoring, and service. However, our focus remains on \ntenure -track faculty because these positions are typically associated with long -term \ninstitutional in vestment, formalized expectations of research productivity, and a central role in \nshaping the academic pipeline through hiring, promotion, and curriculum development. While \nresearch and teaching professors may also mentor PhD students and serve as Principa l \nInvestigators, their institutional roles and career trajectories often differ from those of tenure -\ntrack faculty, particularly in terms of departmental governance, tenure security, and influence \non faculty hiring and promotion processes. Thus, our decisi on to focus on tenure -track faculty \nensures a consistent format and aligns with the study\u2019s aim of examining patterns in faculty \nhiring and academic career progression.  \nResearch Interests and Publication.  A key difficulty in filtering the GISphere dataset is \ndistinguishing between faculty who focus on advancing GIScience and those who use \nGeographic Information Systems (GIS) as tools in various fields. To address this challenge, we \nimplemented a two -step m anual process. First, we examined research interests as listed in \nfaculty profiles, curriculum vitae, and Google Scholar. A faculty member was included if their \nresearch interests explicitly contained GIS -related terminol ogy (e.g., \u201cgeographic information \nsystems,\u201d \u201cspatial analysis,\u201d \u201cgeovisualization,\u201d \u201cremote sensing\u201d). These keywords were \nadopted based on the GIS research themes examined in Wu et al. (2022), who systematically \n\n--- Page 13 ---\n   \n \n   \n 13 parsed GIS journal content to compile a comprehensive list of relevant terminology. Second, \nwe reviewed publication records available on Google Scholar, ResearchGate, and ORCID. \nFaculty were identified as GIScience scholars (i.e., those focused on advancin g GIScience) if \nthey had at least one publication in a recognized GIS -specific journal, or if the title and abstract \nof their publications in non -GIS-specific journals indicated a clear focus on GIS -related topics, \naccording to  the GIS journals and sub -domain topics defined by Wu et al. (2022). Faculty \nwhose profiles and publication records did not meet these criteria were excluded from our \nanalysis, indicating that they primarily use GIS as a tool.  \nPublicly Available Educational Records.  Following the initial identification, we verified \neach professor\u2019s educational background and current affiliation through multiple sources \n(official departmental websites, LinkedIn profiles, personal webpages, curriculum vitae, \nORCID profiles). In cases w here faculty held appointments at multiple institutions, only the \ncurrent, primary (tenure -track) affiliation was recorded. Furthermore, all tenure -track \u2014\nincluding assistant, associate, and full professors (or their U K equivalents, such as lecturers \nand senior lecturers) \u2014were grouped together to focus on overall placement patterns rather than \nrank-specific trends.  \n3.3 Results  \nBy applying the criteria described above, we identified a final dataset comprising 946 GIS \nfaculty members currently affiliated with 384 universities across 27 countries in North America, \nEurope, Asia, and Oceania. The manual data collection process was co mpleted in March 2024, \nand subsequent updates were not included.  \n4. Placement Patterns in GIScience  Faculty Hiring  \n4.1 Network Analysis of Global GIS Faculty Placement  \nIn this section, we utilized network analysis to explore the influential GIS programs as defined \nby those that have the greatest impact on placing PhD graduates in faculty positions. Network \n\n--- Page 14 ---\n   \n \n   \n 14 analysis was employed to assess the global distribution of GIS graduate programs and identify \nkey programs that produce and place graduates as faculties within the field. This method \ninvolves mapping and analyzing relationships between entities within a ne twork, typically \nrepresented as nodes and edges (Hevey, 2018) . Here, universities are depicted as nodes, and \nthe links between these nodes represent the placement of graduates into academic positions.  \nResults from our network analysis revealed that the United States leads with 270 GIS faculty \npositions worldwide, comprising 28.54% of the total. China follows with 253 faculty members, \naccounting for 26.74%. The United Kingdom (N=79) and Canada (N=71) rep resent 8.35% and \n7.51%, respectively. Germany (N=24), Japan (N=23), Switzerland (N=23), and Netherlands \n(N=23) each contribute over 2% to the total. The top eight countries with the most GIS faculty \naccount for 80.97% (766 out of 946) of current GIS facult y positions.  \nOur global GIS faculty placement pattern identifies several influential institutions contributing \nto GIS programs  (Figure 2). Wuhan University and Chinese Academy of Science, both in China, \nlead the way, each accounting for 5.50 percent and 3.38 percent of all GIS faculty, followed \nby University of California Santa Barbara (2.43%), The Ohio State University (2.33%), and \nPeking University (1.80%). Collectively, these five universities account for 15.43% of \nplacements in GIS programs. Conversely, 50 universities placed only two faculty members, \nand 135 universities placed only one faculty member.  Unlike other academic fields with more \nclearer hierarchies, GIS faculty placements are more evenly distributed, which indicates a \nrelatively decentralized hiring pattern in GIS programs. However , it is worth noting that, for \nthe top 25%  (96 out of 384 ) of institution s, they have achieved a placement rate of 70.4%. \nFigure 3 additionally illustrates that the United States has a significant presence among the top \n10 universities for faculty placement. The United States institutions also mak e up 40.63%  (39 \nout of 96)  of the top 25% of educational institutions in terms of GIS faculty placement.  Figure \n3, 4, 5 and 6 illustrates the faculty hiring networks for each continent by displaying the current \n\n--- Page 15 ---\n   \n \n   \n 15 affiliations of GIS faculty alongside the origins of their PhD degrees. To better illustrate the \npatterns of faculty mobility across institutions, we also created an interactive hierarchical edge \nbundling web visualization (link), which dynamically represents the academic hiring flows in \nGIScience.  \nFigure 2. Network graph of global GIS faculty placement. Each node represents a university, \n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n   \n \n   \n 16 and the colors of the nodes indicate the country of origin. The size of each node corresponds \nto the number of GIS faculty members originated from that university, with larger nodes \nindicating a higher number of faculty placements. The edges connecting the  nodes represent \nthe flow of GIS faculty between universities, with thicker edges indicating a greater number of \nfaculty moving from one university to another.  \n\n--- Page 17 ---\n   \n \n   \n 17 \n\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n   \n \n   \n 18 \n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n   \n \n   \n 19 Figure 3.

Faculty Hiring Networks in Oceania.  \n4.2 Diversity Index of Global GIS Faculty Placement  \nThis study introduces a new measure of diversity: the diversity index, based on the proportion \nof faculty originating from all other regions relative to the total affiliated faculty within a \ncertain region. The calculation of the diversity index is not fix ed to a specific numerator and \ndenominator , acknowledging that different spatial scales can yield significantly divergent \noutcomes in geographical studies. Consequently, this investigation explores the diversity of \nacademic networks at multiple spatial sca les, including the continental, country, and \ninstitutional levels.  \n\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc66 \u2008\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 \u2008=\u2008\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \u2008\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc53\u2008\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc66 \u2008\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51  \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5a \u2008\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\u2008\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\u2008\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \u2008\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc53\u2008\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc66 \u2008\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51 \u2008\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\u210e\u2008\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b \u2008\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b (1) \n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n   \n \n   \n 20 In this section, we describe the faculty placement patterns at three different levels \u2014 \ncontinental, country, and institutional  \u2013 as identified from our network analysis. The \ncontinental level analysis reveals cross -border patterns in faculty mobility and hiring. The \ncountry level  analysis  investigates the national distribution and diversity of GIScience faculty. \nThe institutional level  analysis  identifies more nuanced preferences in faculty hiring trends in \nGIS disciplines. Our multi -level analysis aims to demonstrate the internal recruitment ratio at \ndifferent scales and how geographical location affects academic opportunities in the field , and \nall the figures  in Section 4 .2 can be found in the interactive dashboard of GIS faculty hiring  3. \n4.2.1  Diversity Index at Four Continents  \nAmong the 946 GIS faculty reflected in the dataset, 345 faculty members are currently \naffiliated with institutions in North America, 316 in Asia, 260 in Europe, and 25 in Oceania. \nOf all the faculty, 40.49% completed their PhD degrees in North America, 30.87% in Europe, \nand 26.74% in Asia ( Figure 4). The remaining 18 faculty members include 16 who completed \ntheir degrees in Oceania, one in South America, and one in Africa.  \n \n3 https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/6068/viz/GISFacultyHiringNetwork/continent -merimekkochart  \n\n--- Page 21 ---\n   \n \n   \n 21  \nFigure 4. Marimekko chart visualizing the distribution of GIS faculty placements across four \ncontinents (North America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania) and their PhD origins. The X -axis \nrepresents the total number of current GIS faculty in each continent, while the Y -axis shows \nthe percentage of faculty based on where they obtained their Ph.Ds. The width of each segment \non the X -axis corresponds to the number of GIS faculty in that continent, and the colored \nsegments represent the proportion of faculty whose PhD origins  are from different continents. \nFor example, a total of 345 GIS faculty members are currently affiliated with institutions in \nNorth America. Of these, 88.99% obtained their PhDs in North America, 7.83% in Europe, \n2.03% in Asia, 0.87% in Oceania, and 0.29% in Africa.  \nThe diversity index at each continent is calculated by dividing the number of faculty originated \nin all other continents by the number of faculty affiliated with that continent. The diversity \nindex remains relatively low, at 24.37% for Asia, 11.15% for Eur ope, and 11.01% for North \nAmerica, with all values falling below 25%. Oceania, smaller in total number of current GIS \nfaculty, prefers recruitment from European institutions (10) and intercontinental placement (9). \n\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n   \n \n   \n 22 These two groups together account for 76% of the faculty origins in Oceania. This indicates a \nstrong preference for internal retention within the continental -level hiring networks.  \nWe further analyzed the geographic origins of PhD graduates by continent, showing placement \npatterns as displayed in  Figure 5. In North America, GIS faculty predominantly hold Ph.Ds.  \nfrom the United States (257) and Canada (50), complemented by graduates from the U.K. and \nChina. In Europe, the U.K. is the prominent source (64), with other European countries also \ncontributing to the mix. In Asia, the hiring pattern is centralized in Ch ina (202), with Japan (24) \nas a secondary source, and a few representations from Western -educated faculty. For Oceania, \nAustralia is the main provider of GIS PhDs (7), alongside a handful from the U.K (6) and the \nU.S. (4).  \nFigure 5. Tree maps of faculty placement by country. These tree maps visualize the \ndistribution of GIS faculty placements across various countries, segmented into four \ncontinents: (a) North America, (b) Asia, (c) Europe, and (d) Oceania. Each rectangle within \nthe treemap represents a country, with the size of the rectangle proportional to the number of \n\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n   \n \n   \n 23 GIS faculty placements in that continent. The colors distinguish different continents. The \ncountry code labels each rectangle, and the number inside each rectangle indicates how \nmany faculty members who completed their PhD in that country are currently aff iliated with \ninstitutions within that continent. Rectangles without numbers represent countries with only \none faculty placement.  \n4.2.2  Continental -level Diversity Index  \nAt the continental level, the diversity index for each country is calculated by dividing the \nnumber of faculty whose PhDs were obtained in countries outside their continent by the total \nnumber of faculty affiliated with institutions in that country.  The continental level diversity \nindex highlights the extent to which countries rely on talent from other continents. A higher \nindex at this level indicates significant international mobility. The average diversity index is \n14.27%; in other words, countries, on average, hire only 14.27% of their faculties with a PhD \nearned from other continents  (Figure 6). Only eight countries exceed this average: five from \nAsia, two from Oceania, and one from Europe. Except for China, all these countries have 15 \nor fewer GIS faculty members. In Table 1, except for Singapore (100%), New Zealand \n(90.91%), South Korea (73.33%), and Malaysia (66.67%), all other countries show a relatively \nlow diversity index, indicating  that their hiring decisions tend to favor domestic or regionally \nlocal candidates over international applicants.  \n\n--- Page 24 ---\n   \n \n   \n 24 Figure 6. Diversity index at the continental level.  This figure shows the distribution of GIS \nfaculty across 27 countries, divided by the location where they earned their PhD degrees. \nThe average continental -level diversity index is 14.27%, with countries ranked by this ratio, \nstarting with Singapore, down to Austria.  The horizontal bars represent the percentage of \nfaculty in each country who earned their PhD in either the same continent as their current \ninstitution (blue) or a different continent (orange). Black numbers represent faculty with \nPhDs from other continents , and white numbers show those with PhDs from the same \ncontinent.  \n4.2.3  Country -level Diversity Index  \nAt the country level, the diversity index for each country is calculated by dividing the number \nof faculty whose PhDs were awarded in countries other than the country itself by the total \nnumber of faculty affiliated with that country.  Figure 7 demonstrates varying degrees of \nreliance on domestic versus international academic expertise in the field, with an average \n\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n   \n \n   \n 25 Diversity Index of 25.21%. Countries like Singapore and Thailand stand out with the highest \ndiversity, where all of their GIS faculty have obtained PhD internationally. Conversely, France, \nItaly, and Estonia show the lowest diversity, with their faculties comprised entirely of domestic \nPhD holders. Middle -ground countries such as the United States and China have more \ninternational representation, with diversity index ratios of 12.30% and 20.50%, respectively. \nThe countries with the highest diversity indices  tend to have a relatively low number of faculty \npositions; eight countries with a diversity index over 50% do not exceed 15 faculty members. \nMeanwhile, the top four countries with the most GIS faculty demonstrate modest or low \ninternational representation : the US at 12.30%, China at 20.55%, the UK at 29.21%, with only \nCanada showing a higher rate at 42.75%.  \nFigure 7. Domestic PhD Ratio and International PhD Ratio for each Countries. This figure \n\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n   \n \n   \n 26 shows the distribution of faculty by PhD origin across 27 countries, highlighting domestic \nversus international PhD ratios. The average international PhD ratio is 25.21%, with \ncountries ranked by this ratio, starting with Singapore, which has the highest p ercentage of \ninternationally educated faculty, down to Italy. Blue bars represent the percentage of faculty \nwith PhDs earned domestically, while orange bars show those with international PhDs. Black \nnumbers on orange bars indicate the count of internationa l PhD holders, and white numbers \non blue bars show domestic PhD holders.  \n4.2.4  Institutional Diversity Index  \nAt the institutional level, the diversity index for each institution is calculated by dividing the \nnumber of faculty whose PhDs were obtained from institutions other than the current one by \nthe total number of faculty affiliated with that institution.  We examined the diversity index \nfor every institution and grouped by countries, indicating an institution's inclination to hire \nfaculty with PhDs from outside its own institutions, which can be understood as the non -self-\nhired ratio (Wapman et al. 2022) . The average diversity index is 60.66%. In Figure 8, \nInstitutions in South Korea, Singapore, Republic of Ireland and Thailand show 100% non -\nself-hired ratio. Conversely, Estonia, Austria, De nmark, Japan and Belgium show high \ninternal retention, exceeding 60% of their faculty having earned their PhDs from the same \ninstitutions where they are currently affiliated. The top four countries with the highest \nnumber of GIS faculty positions all exhibi t a strong preference for non -self-hiring. In North \nAmerica, the United States and Canada display external hiring ratios of 94.59% and 85.78%, \nrespectively. The U.K. follows with an external hiring ratio of 77.22%, and China shows a \nrelatively higher pref erence for internal retention among these countries, at 73.52%.  \n\n--- Page 27 ---\n   \n \n   \n 27 Figure 8. Self -hired ratio and non -self-hired ratio in each country.  Orange bars represent the \nnon-self-hired ratio, while blue bars represent self -hired ratio. Black numbers on the bars show \nthe count of externally retained faculty, white numbers represent internally retained faculty. \nThe chart is ordered by non -self-hired ratio, with countries like the Republic of Ireland and \nSingapore having the highest non -self-hired ratio. The average non -self-hired ratio 60.66%.  \n4.2.5  Comparison of Diversity Index at Different Level  \nThe diversity index at different levels \u2014continental, country, and institutional \u2014provides \ninsights into the geographic and institutional preferences in academic hiring at different regions \n(Table 1). It is worth noticing that the difference between the continental and country -level \ndiversity indices reveals not only the degree of international diversity but also the influence of \n\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n   \n \n   \n 28 neighboring countries in faculty hiring. For example, 10 European countries exceed the average \ncountry -level diversity index (25.21%), but the number drops to 4 when comparing the average \ncontinental level diversity index (14.27%), and 9 European countries  show 0% at the \ncontinental level. This indicates that most countries in Europe tend to hire PhD graduates from \nwithin the continent even if not from their own country. Canada shows the same trend : the \nDiversity Index for Canada fell significantly from 42. 25% at the country level to 14.08% at the \ncontinental level. Of the 71 faculty in Canada, 41 earned their PhD within the country, and 20 \nwere educated in the United States. Conversely, the United States does not show a similar \npreference for hiring from it s neighboring country. Though the U.S. Diversity Index decreased \nfrom 12.22% at country level to 8.89% at continental level, only 9 faculty received their PhD \nfrom Canadian institutions.  \nTable 1. Diversity index across different levels. The dots following the country names represent \nthe level of socio -economic development. Blue dots represent the Western countries, while red \ndots represent the Non -Western countries. The continental level diversit y index measures the \nproportion of faculty whose PhD was earned outside their continent compared to the total \nnumber of faculty affiliated with institutions within that country. The country -level diversity \nindex essentially measures the extent of domestic hiring versus bringing in talent from abroad. \nAt the institutional level, the diversity index provides a measure of internal retention versus \nexternal recruitment. For example, In North America, 11.01% of current GIS faculty obtained \ntheir PhD from institu tions outside of the continent. Within Canada, 14.08% of GIS faculty \nearned their PhD from institutions outside of North America, while 42.25% obtained their PhD \n\n--- Page 29 ---\n   \n \n   \n 29 from institutions outside of Canada itself. At the institutional level within Canada, 88.73% of \nGIS faculty are employed at institutions different from where they received their PhD.  \nContinent  Country or \nRegion   Continental \nLevel  Country \nLevel  Institutional \nlevel  Current  \nGIS \nFaculty  \nNorth \nAmerica  Canada   14.08%  42.25%  88.73%  71 \n11.01%  United States   8.89%  12.22%  93.33%  270 \nAsia Singapore   100.00%  100.00%  100.00%  6 \n24.37%  Thailand   0.00%  100.00%  100.00%  2 \n South Korea   73.33%  73.33%  100.00%  15 \n Malaysia   66.67%  66.67%  66.67%  3 \n Israel   50.00%  50.00%  66.67%  12 \n China   20.16%  20.55%  73.52%  253 \n Japan   4.35%  8.70%  39.13%  23 \nEurope  Ireland   0.00%  80.00%  100.00%  5 \n11.15%  Norway   22.22%  55.56%  66.67%  9 \n Netherlands   4.35%  47.83%  86.96%  23 \n Switzerland   13.04%  43.48%  47.83%  23 \n Belgium   20.00%  40.00%  40.00%  5 \n Denmark   0.00%  36.36%  36.36%  11 \n Sweden   11.11%  33.33%  50.00%  18 \n Poland   0.00%  33.33%  66.67%  3 \n UK  20.25%  29.11%  77.22%  79 \n\n--- Page 30 ---\n   \n \n   \n 30  Germany   0.00%  20.83%  95.83%  24 \n Austria   0.00%  12.50%  31.25%  16 \n Finland   0.00%  10.00%  70.00%  10 \n Czech Republic   20.00%  29.09%  63.64%  11 \n Italy  0.00%  0.00%  50.00%  4 \n France   0.00%  0.00%  90.91%  11 \n Estonia   0.00%  0.00%  0.00%  1 \nOceania  New Zealand   90.91%  90.91%  90.91%  11 \n64.00%  Australia   38.46%  46.15%  53.85%  13 \n Western   13.17%  32.15%  65.01%  618 \n Non-Western   44.93%  59.89%  78.00%  314 \nThe analysis of diversity indices reveals significant disparities in the geographic representation \nof GIS faculty between Western and Non -Western countries. Our findings indicate that GIS \nscholarship is highly centralized in Western countries, leaving many Non -Western countries \nunderrepresented. This trend aligns with the global distribution of geoscientists, as exemplified \nby the fact that countries such as the United States, the United Ki ngdom, and Germany \naccounted for over 60% of international collaborations in leading journals like Nature \nGeoscience between 2008 and 2017 (\u201cGlobalized Geoscience,\u201d 2018). Moreover, Western \ncountries exhibit lower diversity indices across all levels, sugge sting that faculty in these \nregions are more likely to have earned their PhDs within their own continent and that \ninstitutions tend to favor domestic hiring. In contrast, Non -Western countries demonstrate \nhigher diversity indices, indicating a greater prop ensity to recruit faculty with international \neducational backgrounds.  \n4.3  Language Congruency Analysis  \n\n--- Page 31 ---\n   \n \n   \n 31 Language barriers are widely recognized as a factor influencing faculty placement. To examine \nthis effect, we conducted a language congruency analysis comparing the primary language of \ninstruction at each faculty member\u2019s PhD -granting institution with both  the language(s) used \nat their current institution and the official language(s) of the region in which it is located. Our \nstudy did not incorporate each faculty member\u2019s first language due to the difficulty of tracking \nsuch information from public sources.  \nFigure 9. Language Congruency Analysis.  \nWe focused on the top five languages with the highest institutional counts  (Figure 9). Each \nuniversity was annotated with its language(s) of instruction, primary language, and the regional \nofficial language. A placement was labeled as a \u201cMatch\u201d if the languages were identical, \n\u201cPartial Match\u201d if there was some overlap between the language(s) of instruction or with the \nregional official language, and \u201cNon -match\u201d if no common language was found. Overall, each \nlanguage group shows a \u201cMatch\u201d rate of at least 50 percent, and when \u201cPartial Match\u201d is \nincluded, the combined figure exceeds 85 percent f or every group. This suggests that, in the \nmajority of cases, the PhD -granting institution and the hiring institution (or its region) share at \n\n\n--- Page 32 ---\n   \n \n   \n 32 least one common language, highlighting the significant role that linguistic compatibility plays \nin faculty placements. Chinese institutions exhibit the highest non -match rate (15%), many of \nthese cases represent Chinese faculty who graduated from Western universities (e.g., the US \nand Canada) and returned to China. This outcome also reflects language congruency in a \nbroader sense.  \nIt is worth noting that, especially in many European countries where English is not the primary \nlanguage, institutions often offer graduate -level courses in English or explicitly maintain an \nEnglish -language research environment. This practice not only hel ps lower language barriers \nfor scholars whose native language differs from the local medium of instruction, but also \nunderscores the global importance of English in GIScience academic environment.  \n5.  GIS Research Themes  \nAfter examining faculty hiring networks, we shift our focus to the research themes pursued by \nthese faculty. Faculty placements are influenced not only by qualifications but also by the need \nto align institutional research goals with emerging trends. The focus areas of newly hired \nfaculty help determine which sub -disciplines develop and how research priorities ar e set, \nthereby impacting future academic directions in their institutions. By analyzing research \nthemes, we aim to reveal how hiring patterns contribute to the growth of specific areas within \nthe discipline and reflect the underlying priorities of academic  institutions. This analysis \nbridges the study of faculty placements with the broader narrative of knowledge transmission \nin GIScience.  \n5.1  Methods  \nIdentifying latent topics requires an understanding of the listed research interests of each \nscholar in the dataset and categorizing them into several classes. To achieve this goal, a four -\nstep approach is taken, which involves (1) sentence embedding, (2) spatial clustering, (3) \nsemantic analysis, and (4) data visualization.  \n\n--- Page 33 ---\n   \n \n   \n 33 Sentence embedding is a technique in natural language processing (NLP) that transforms a \nsentence into a fixed -length vector of numbers . These vectors (embeddings) capture the \nsemantic meaning of the sentence or a list of words, which is the precondition of the \ndownstream tasks such as sentence similarity analysis and sentence clustering  (Bodrunova et \nal., 2020; Khan et al., 2020) . To take advantage of the progress in NLP, we leveraged \ntransformer -based large language models implemented by Langchain4 to accomplish this task \nsuch that the embedding can capture the complex meanings of the research interests  (Reimers \n& Gurevych, 2019) .  \nSpatial clustering method is then applied to separate the high -dimension sentence embedding \ninto several spatial clusters. K -means clustering, DBSCAN, Hierarchical clustering, and \nSpectral clustering are commonly used clustering methods to separate geospat ial data. Spectral \nclustering (Von Luxburg, 2007)  uses eigenvalues of the similarity matrix of the data to perform \ndimension reduction before clustering and is capable of capturing  intricate relationships \nbetween points, which is good for non -convex clusters. It is suitable to the task of clustering \nsentence embedding and leveraged in this study.  \nThe t -distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t -SNE) is a dimension reduction method \nfrequently used in machine learning. It is particularly effective at preserving the local structure \nof data and revealing patterns in datasets with complex relationship s (Van der Maaten & Hinton, \n2008) . In this study, t -SNE is used to reduce the high -dimension sentence embedding to two \ndimensions to visualize and evaluate the clustering results.   \nTo better understand the semantic of each research cluster identified by the aforementioned \nmethods, word cloud visualization and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are utilized. Word \ncloud visualization is widely used in information extraction and keyword metadata depicting \n \n4 https://www.langchain.com/  \n\n--- Page 34 ---\n   \n \n   \n 34 of social media posts (e.g., ref A, ref B, etc.) and was adopted  in this study. It draws a collection \nof words in various sizes based on word frequency (Yum, 2020; Zhou et al., 2024) . LDA is a \nBayesian -based probabilistic unsupervised topic modeling algorithm that detects hidden topics \nregarded as a multinomial distribution over words (Blei, 2003) . In other words, the detected \ntopics in which high -frequency words are more likely to be present are the ones that occur more \noften in the collection of sentences.  \n5.2  Clusters Based on Placements  \n5.2.1  Clustering Results  \nAfter applying Transformer based large language model to the research interests of each faculty, \nthe research interests are embedded to a 734 -dimention vector. Then, the spectral clustering \nmethod is applied to group the vectors. The number of clusters, K,  is the hyperparameter that \nneeds to be tuned during the calculation process. Based on the GIST body of knowledge \n(GIS&T Body of Knowledge Visualization and Search , 2024) , there are 10 knowledge areas, \ntherefore we set the maximum value of K=10. We perform the clustering calculation iteratively \nwith the value of K starting  from 3 to 10. Since no ground truth data is available for the \nclustering task, visual inspection is applied to evaluate the impact of different K values on the \nclustering performance.  Scatter plots of the clustering results are drawn after reducing the \nembedding to 2 -dimension using t -SNE. We observed clear separation, compact and cohesive \nclusters, cons istent shapes, and few overlapping or scattered clusters when K=7. The cluster \nresult after dimension reduction is shown in  Figure 10.  \n\n--- Page 35 ---\n   \n \n   \n 35  \nFigure 10. Spectral clustering results of research interests after dimension reduction by t -\nSNE. Cluster 1: Environmental and ecological analysis, remote sensing; Cluster 2: Urban \nplanning and social geography; Cluster 3: Cartography and visualization; Cluster 4: \nGeospatial data analysis and modeling; Cluster 5: Spatial a nalysis and urban systems; \nCluster 6: 3D modeling; and Cluster 7: Health geography.  \n5.2.2  Cluster Semantics  \nTo have a more intuitive understanding of each research cluster, semantic analysis is performed \nusing LDA and word cloud visualization. The result of the LDA model indicates a robust and \nreliable identification of distinct topics within the dataset. Each t opic is characterized by a \ncoherent set of high -probability words that collectively provide a clear thematic interpretation. \nThe topics for each cluster are listed below:  \nCluster1: Environmental and ecological analysis, remote sensing  \nCluster2: Urban planning and social geography  \nCluster3: Cartography and visualization  \n\n\n--- Page 36 ---\n   \n \n   \n 36 Cluster4: Geospatial data analysis and modeling  \nCluster5: Spatial analysis and urban systems  \nCluster6: 3D modeling  \nCluster7: Health geography  \nEnvironmental and ecological analysis, urban planning and social geography, and geospatial \ndata analysis and modelling are the largest three research clusters. The topics exhibit minimal \noverlap, suggesting well -defined boundaries between different themati c areas, which enhances \nthe interpretability of the results. Additionally, the distribution of topics across documents is \nconsistent with the expected thematic patterns, reinforcing the reliability of the LDA results. \nThis outcome provides valuable insight s for further analysis and interpretation.   \nThe word cloud for each cluster is visualized in Figure 11 to further validate the result. The \nsize of each word in the word cloud corresponds to its frequency or importance within the text. \nLarger words appear  more frequently or hold greater significance, while smaller words are less \ncommon or less significant. The differences in color are intended  to improve visual \ndiscriminability.  \nThe result of the word clouds visualization provides an immediate visual summary of the most \nimportant terms and is coherent with the LDA results, which further demonstrates the reliability \nof the research cluster identified.  \n\n--- Page 37 ---\n   \n \n   \n 37 Figure 11. Word cloud visualization for each research cluster.   \n5.3  Clusters Based on Semantic Word cloud  \n\n\n--- Page 38 ---\n   \n \n   \n 38 As an interdisciplinary field, GIScience  has evolved from a focus on GIS applications to a \nflourishing scientific discipline, experiencing significant expansion in its sub -domains over \nthe past three decades. To trace these developments, we analyzed the research interests of \nfaculty using semant ic word clouds. Out of 946 faculty members, 755 had listed their PhD \ngraduation years on their profiles. We classified them into four groups according to their \ngraduation periods to examine their research focuses, the time periods were chosen to reflect \nsignificant phases in the evolution of GIScience. Figure 12 presents the research interests of \nfaculty who completed their PhDs within the following periods: 1990 and earlier (52), 1991 -\n2000 (161), 2001 -2010 (299), and 2011 onwards (243).  \nIn our analysis, we excluded broad research themes like spatial analysis, spatial data science, \nand Geographic Information Systems, aiming to explore the evolution of sub -topics or cross -\ndiscipline topics.  \n\n--- Page 39 ---\n   \n \n   \n 39 Figure 12. Word cloud visualization of the research interests of faculty who completed their \nPhDs across four periods.  \nOverall, our analysis highlights four notable trends in GIS -related research interests over time. \nFirst, beyond the consistently present themes such as remote sensing, cartography, and \ntransportation, different focuses emerge across different groups. Facul ty who graduated from \n1991 to 2000 possessed research interests that emphasize natural studies, such as biogeography, \nhydrology, and climate, reflecting the integration of GIScience with environmental disciplines. \nAmong the third group (2001 -2010), cartogr aphy -related sub -topics were frequently \nmentioned, including mapping, geovisualization, visualization, and visual analytics. Since \n2011, the focus has pivoted to more detailed urban issues, with topics such as urban computing, \nurban analytics, and urban in formatics being particularly prominent. Second, there is a clear \ntrajectory toward increasingly interdisciplinary research interests. Faculty with PhDs before \n1990 concentrated on soil science, urban studies, and transportation. From 1991 -2000, the \n\n\n--- Page 40 ---\n   \n \n   \n 40 scope expanded to include environmental science topics. After 2000, the diversity of interests \ngrew further to include research on geoscience and human geography. Third, computational \ntechnology has emerged as a significant focus since 2001. Machine learni ng, data mining, and \ngeocomputation were listed between 2001 and 2010, and were further branched into \nspecialized themes in Geography such as GeoAI, and urban computing from 2011 to present. \nThis trend parallels the rise of AI since the early 2000s. Fourth , the frequent mention of \nparticipatory GIS, Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), and critical GIS indicates a \ngrowing interest in placing humans at the center of GIS inquiries.  \n6.  Discussion  \nThis study examines global GIS faculty placements and research interests by analyzing faculty \nhiring patterns at continental, country, and institutional levels. We list several takeaways that \nmay offer insights for future students  and the broader GIS community.  \n6.1 High Internal Recruitment at Continent Level and Country Level  \nAnalyzing faculty hiring at the continental and country levels reveals a tendency toward \ninternal recruitment. In other words, academic institutions prefer to hire faculty who obtained \ntheir PhD within the same country or continent, reflecting a strong inclination to hire local \ntalent . Several factors may explain this pattern:  \nInstitutions\u2019 Legacy.  Countries with long -standing academic traditions often develop strong \neducational infrastructures that can favor the development of faculty from within their own \nranks, potentially reducing the reliance on academics from outside. For instance, well -\nestabl ished universities tend to build extensive networks of alumni who continue their careers \nwithin the same national or regional context. This can create a self -sustaining cycle where local \ngraduates are more likely to be hired as faculty , reinforcing the internal recruitment trend. \nAdditionally, these institutions often have established pipelines for nurturing academic talents \n\n--- Page 41 ---\n   \n \n   \n 41 from undergraduate through to postgraduate levels, which further entrenches internal \nrecruitment.  \nGeopolitical Dynamics.  The state of a country's diplomatic relationships and trade agreements \ncan shape the movement of academic talent. Countries that maintain open and strong \ninternational connections tend to experience more academic exchanges. In contrast, countries \nwith res trictive immigration policies or strained international relations may see a reduced influx \nof international faculty. For example, countries within the European Union (EU) benefit from \npolicies that facilitate the free movement of peop le. Based on our diversity index analysis, the \nindex for nine European countries at the continental level is 0%, indicating that these countries \npredominantly hire faculty from within Europe. This finding highlights the effectiveness of \nintra-European poli cies, such as free movement agreements, which not only facilitate academic \nexchanges within Europe but also tend to retain European scholars on the continent, thereby \nlimiting cross -continental mobility. Due to free movement, geographic proximity, and stro ng \nintra-regional networks (e.g., among DACH or Benelux countries), the EU often functions as \na single integrated market. An international move within the EU \u2014such as between Germany \nand Austria \u2014is less significant than moves between regions with greater ba rriers, such as \nbetween Germany and the United Kingdom or between an EU country and a non -EU country \nlike New Zealand.  \nGeographical Proximity.  Canada\u2019s diversity index drops from 42.25% at the country level to \n14.08% at the continental level, indicating heavy reliance on the U.S. for academic talents. \nSimilarly, in Europe, countries like Ireland, Norway, the Netherlands, and Switzerland \nexperien ce substantial drops in their diversity indices \u2014each exceeding 20% \u2014when shifting \nfrom the country level to the continental level, underscoring the importance of geographically \nneighboring countries in academic hiring.  \n\n--- Page 42 ---\n   \n \n   \n 42 Financial Considerations . The expenses associated with campus visits for potential hires, \nwhich cover accommodation and travel, can be substantially higher for international candidates. \nThis might influence the preference for candidates within the country or from geographically \nneighboring countries to manage costs. Institutions operating on limited budgets might \nprioritize local candidates to minimize recruitment expenses. Moreover, funding bodies and \ngrants often have stipulations that favor hiring local talent, further incentivizing institutions to \nlook inward rather than abroad. This financial prudence can lead to a concentration of hiring \nwithin specific regions, impacting the diversity  of academic staff.  \nCultural Barriers.  Language differences and varying academic traditions can impede \ncollaboration among researchers across regions. Our language congruency analysis indicates \nthat scholars are more likely to remain at universities where there is at least one common \nlanguage shared between their PhD institution or the current region. From the scholars\u2019 \nperspective, cultural barriers often lead them to actively choose familiar linguistic \nenvironments. From the institutions\u2019 perspective, such preferences can fo ster more localized \nacademic networks in regions characterized by cultural and linguistic homogeneity, potentially \nrestricting the broader circulation of knowledge.  \nPersonal factors , including professional networks and institutional ties, could also influence \nwhere and how scholars pursue their careers. Many researchers rely on their established \nnetworks when making career decisions, such as connections with mentors, colleagues, and \nalumni. These networks provide insider information and opportunities for collaboration, often \nmaking it more attractive for scholars to remain within familiar institutions or regions. As a \nresult, internal recruitment is reinforced. This lo calized hiring can, in turn, influence the \ndistribution of research interests, when a particular region or institution is dominated by \nspecific academic traditions or research themes, new hires are likely to align with those \nestablished paradigms.  \n\n--- Page 43 ---\n   \n \n   \n 43 6.2 High External Recruitment at Institutional Level  \nPreviously, the absence of unified data limited the study of global GIS faculty mobility. The \nGISphere database now facilitates these investigations, marking a significant contribution to \nthe field. Our institutional analysis showed that institutions gener ally prefer hiring faculty from \noutside their own system to foster intellectual  diversity and avoid academic inbreeding. These \nnon-self-hire practices are particularly notable in the United States. In our data, non -self-hiring \naccounts for approximately 94.59% of all U.S. GIS professors, the highest proportion among \nthe top four coun tries with the most current GIS faculty. This observation aligns with prior \nstudies on non -self-hire trends across countries (Wapman et al. 2022) . \nHiring externally may bring in new perspectives and expertise, which can invigorate academic \nprograms and stimulate innovative research. For example, faculty from diverse academic \nbackgrounds can enhance the overall quality of research and teaching within an institution \n(Wiggins & Sawyer, 2012) . Additionally, external hires can mitigate the risks of groupthink \n(Klein & Stern, 2009) , which can occur when an institution relies heavily on internally \ndeveloped faculty. Groupthink can stifle creativity and limit the diversity of thought necessary \nfor addressing complex scientific research problems. By incorporating faculty from various \nacademic and cultural backgrounds, institutions can foster a more dynamic academic \nenvironment.  \n6.3 Global GIS Program and Overall Trend  \nCertain institutions with influential GIS programs have been particularly successful at placing \ntheir graduates in faculty positions at other universities, such as Wuhan university, Chinese \nAcademy of Science, and University of California Santa Barbara . It is encouraging to observe \nthat, compared with fields such as Computer Science and Urban Planning \u2014 where a larger \nshare of placements is concentrated among a few institutions \u2014 GIScience exhibits a more \nequitable distribution of faculty positions. The  global leading five universities account for only \n\n--- Page 44 ---\n   \n \n   \n 44 15.43% of such placements, implying a balanced distribution in GIScience. We advocate for \nsustaining the equality in academic hiring within the field. It is also important to recognize that \nexternal factors, such as the quality, quantity, and size of acade mic programs, also influence \nfaculty placements. Universities that offer higher -quality programs and maintain robust \nresearch environments are likely to produce more competitive graduates, thereby naturally \nleading to higher placement rates. For example, a ccording to the QS World University \nRankings for Geography 2024 (2025), institutions in the United Kingdom and the United States \neach account for 19% of the top 100 universities, following by China mainland (7%). This \ndistribution aligns with our analysis,  as a higher proportion of GIS faculty originate from these \ncountries. Furthermore, the availability of PhD programs is not uniform across countries \u2014\nsome countries lack sufficient PhD programs or have few of them, which further influences the \nobserved plac ement patterns. Future studies could investigate changes over longer periods, \nsuch as 10, 20, and even 30 years, to determine whether faculty hiring in GIScience exhibits \npatterns of academic inequity. This longitudinal approach would allow for a more \ncomp rehensive understanding of hiring trends and whether they lead to an imbalance in \nacademic opportunities over time. Moreover, the observed clusters and cross -border \nplacements highlight the importance of interdisciplinary work in the field. The GIS communi ty \nbenefits from a diverse and inclusive academic environment that encourages collaboration and \ninnovation. By examining the factors that contribute to successful faculty placements, such as \nresearch output, industry partnerships, and international collabo rations, we can better \nunderstand how to create equitable opportunities for all graduates. A detailed analysis of \nresearch clusters based on faculty research interests can reveal whether certain sub -disciplines \nwithin GIScience are more prone to concentrat ion in a few institutions. Identifying these \npatterns could facilitate a more balanced distribution of academic opportunities. For instance, \n\n--- Page 45 ---\n   \n \n   \n 45 promoting mentorship programs and collaborative research projects can enhance academic \ndiversity and inclusivity in GIScience.  \nThe dominance of Western countries, particularly the United States, in the GIS academic hiring \nmarket highlights a significant imbalance  in the global distribution of GIS expertise, with many \nnon-Western countries remaining notably underrepresented. The U.S. accounts for 28.54% of \ncurrent global GIS faculty, with 40.49% of GIS faculty earning their PhD degrees in the U.S. \nFurthermore, U.S.  institutions represent 40.63% of the top 25% of educational institutions in \nterms of GIS faculty placement. This imbala nce highlights the need for intentional efforts to \nsupport GIScience PhD candidates from developing countries and to strengthen GIS programs \nwithin these regions, fostering a more inclusive and globally representative academic \ncommunity.  \n6.4 Shifting Focus and Emerging Trends in GIS Research Clusters  \nThe clustering results highlight the diversity of research interests among GIS faculty, with \nseven well -defined clusters identified: Environmental and ecological analysis, Urban planning \nand social geography, Cartography and visualization, Geospatial data analysis and modeling, \nSpatial analysis and urban systems, 3D modeling, and Health geography. These clusters exhibit \nminimal overlap, indicating clear boundaries between thematic areas and suggesting that \nGIScience is becoming increasingly specialized. The  largest clusters, namely Environmental \nand Ecological Analysis, Urban and Social Geography, and Geospatial Data Analysis and \nModeling, underscore the strong emphasis on environmental and urban issues, reflecting the \nfield\u2019s response to pressing global cha llenges.  \nThe temporal analysis of research interests through semantic word clouds reveals significant \nshifts in the focus of GIS research across different academic generations. Earlier cohorts, \nparticularly those graduating before 2000, were primarily focused on na tural and \n\n--- Page 46 ---\n   \n \n   \n 46 environmental sciences, reflecting the early integration of GIS technology with ecological and \nhydrological studies. As the field matured, there was a shift towards urban -related topics and \nthe adoption of advanced computational techniques, such as machine  learning, geocomputation, \nand GeoAI, particularly among those who graduated after 2000. This evolution demonstrates \nthe increasing interdisciplinarity of GIS research, with a growing emphasis on urban \ninformatics and the application of GIS in understandin g complex human -environment \ninteractions. Additionally, the rise of participatory GIS and critical GIS themes indicates a \ntrend towards incorporating social dimensions and human -centric approaches within \nGIScience.  \nIn conclusion, addressing the concentration of faculty placements in influential GIS programs \nis crucial for ensuring a diverse and equitable academic environment. By investigating long -\nterm trends and fostering interdisciplinary and international collaborations, the GIS community \ncan promote a more inclusive future for the development of GIScience.  \n6.5 Limitations and Future Work  \nWe acknowledge several limitations in our study. The first issue relates to the scope of our \ndatabase. Despite our efforts to comprehensively collect data on GIS faculty worldwide, it is \nlikely that we did not capture all relevant individuals. This oversig ht may be attribute to several \nfactors, including missing institutions or GIS -related programs, and the absence of certain \nfaculty on departmental website. There may be inherent biases in the dataset due to the \ngeographic distribution of the volunteers who  contributed to its creation. Since many of the \nvolunteers are more familiar with institutions in the North America and Europe and other well -\nrepresented regions, the database might have more complete information on faculty from these \nareas, potentially un derrepresenting GIS scholars from institutions in non -Western countries, \nespecially for institutions in Africa and South America. In our attempts to collect information \nfrom non -Western countries, we also encountered challenges such as language barriers an d the \n\n--- Page 47 ---\n   \n \n   \n 47 lack of publicly available data. In future work, we plan to address this limitation by leveraging \nparticipatory GIS approaches to enhance data collection from underrepresented regions. \nFurthermore, the reliance on publicly available information may skew th e dataset toward \ninstitutions that are more transparent and active in maintaining accessible online profiles for \ntheir faculty. In addition, while our analysis centers on doctoral training due to data consistency, \nit is important to recognize that postdoct oral experiences and a myriad of other personal and \nprofessional factors frequently play a crucial role in determining faculty trajectories. Despite \nthese limitations, we believe that the data collected captures key trends within GIScience \nfaculty hiring. Our study provides detailed analysis of global placement patterns and highlights \nthe role of academic networks in shaping the dissemination of GIScience knowledge.  \nSecond, despite our efforts to refine our inclusion criteria, our operational definition of GIS \nfaculty, which is based on research interests and publication records, may inadvertently include \nindividuals who primarily identify as experts in other fields, even though they have conducted \nresearch related to GIS. Conversely, the inherent ambiguity and conflicting terminology within \nGIScience may have resulted in the inadvertent exclusion of some relevant faculty. Moreover, \nour focus on tenure -track faculty ma y introduce biases by overlooking the contributions of non -\ntenure -track professionals, who also play a significant role in the field. It is also important to \nnote that the concept of \u201ctenure track\u201d varies across countries and institutions, with some not \noffering tenure -track positions at all or employing different criteria and guidelines for tenure. \nNevertheless, we believe that our results provide a relatively comprehensive and objective \nreflection of faculty placement in GIS.   \nThird, our network analysis of faculty placement focuses solely on comparing faculty members\u2019 \nPhD institutions with their current affiliations, and thus does not thoroughly examine their full \nacademic trajectories \u2014such as their bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degr ees or past appointments. \nFuture studies could aim to construct a more detailed picture of the academic trajectories of \n\n--- Page 48 ---\n   \n \n   \n 48 GIS faculty. Additionally, our analysis does not account for other factors that may influence \nfaculty placements, such as individual qualifications, demographics, or the size of PhD \nprograms. Larger programs are likely to produce more PhD graduates, which may affect their \nrepresentation in faculty placements. However, PhD program size is inherently variable, and \ndepartments rarely disclose specific figures. Consequently, using the number of faculty \noriginated as a proxy measure is a common practice in facul ty placement studies (Clauset et \nal., 2015; C. A. Lee, 2022) . Further research could investigate these factors to gain deeper \ninsights into the decision -making processes behind GIS faculty appointments. A further \nlimitation of our study is that we lack data on the applicant pool for these positions; if \ninternationa l candidates apply in lower volumes than domestic candidates, this could partly \nexplain the higher percentage of domestic hires, independent of internal gatekeeping or bias. \nMoreover, while we identified influential GIS institutions based on faculty placem ent in PhD \nprograms, academia represents only one career path for students. Many students may opt for \ncareers in the industry and choose to enroll in institutions that offer professional GIS programs \nor master's degrees instead of pursuing PhD degrees. Con sequently, it is possible that some \ninstitutions that supply strong candidates to the GIS industry are overlooked in this study. In \nthe future, we aim to explore influential programs within the industry to see if they reflect the \ntrends observed in academi a. \nDisclosure statement  \nNo potential competing interest  was reported by the author(s).  \n \nAcknowledgement  \nThe authors would like to thank all volunteers and contributors to the GISphere project and its \ncommunity for their valuable efforts and support.
